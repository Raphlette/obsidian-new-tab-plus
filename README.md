# New Tab +

## Main feature

New Tab+ allows you to open Markdown files, graphs, canvases, images, audio, video, and PDFs in a new tab by default.

## Optional feature

- When opening a file or canvas, if the file is already open in another tab, the plugin will focus on the existing tab instead of opening a duplicate. (This feature is toggleable.)

# Bugs / issues

It is my first plugin project on Obsidian so don't hesitate to report me any unwanted behavior on https://github.com/Raphlette/obsidian-new-tab-plus/issues.
